#+STARTUP: nofold

* Changelog
** 2.0.0-rc.1 [2020-12-24 Thu]
This is a big release, with a lot of additions and some breaking changes. It
consists of around [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/-/compare/1.6.3...2.0.0-rc.1][140 commits]], which you can see more in depth on compare page.

The primary goal was to refactor styles for major components and make it as
/simple/ as possible, not /simpler/. Another goal of mine was to make things more
maintainable, so that others can get started much more easily than before.

Most importantly, for me at least, was to make things as /consistent/ as possible,
both about the look of Dark-GitLab and the code that powers it.

*** Added
- Ported *procedural color generator* from my other userstyles
  + This release of Dark-GitLab is the first one to ship the latest iteration.
  + You can set your own base =background=, =foreground=, and =accent= colors, or
    choose from a few built-in color-schemes. More colors will be added.
  + Additionally, you can also tweak the intensity of generated syntax colors.
- An option to disable styles for Monaco Editor
- An option to disable styles for IDE area
- An option to enable compact pipelines
  + Disabled by default because of /random/ glitches in GitLab's UI due to how
    jobs area is calculated and rendered.
  + In my current environment, it works great with my hack/workaround.
  + This feature was contributed by [[https://gitlab.com/Preisschild][Florian Ströger]] in last few releases.

*** Removed
- All options for color customization (except shadow and inverse color) are
  removed in favor of aforementioned procedural color generator.
  - Currently, the v3 of color generator doesn't support light mode colors, but
    in one of the next releases that is likely going to be added.

*** Improved
- Buttons have been through a major rewrite
  + All buttons are now consistent. Yes, /all/ of them.
- Labels have also received a major rewrite
  + Similar story to buttons, now much more consistent and usable in dark mode.
- Dropdowns have been rewritten as well
  + Far less buggy than before, given how bad things got over time.
- Added vastly better colors in commit/inline diffs, and merge conflict areas
- Updated colors for alerts, cards, icons, badges, labels, diffs, and more
- Updated and simplified a ton styles for notes, pipelines, sidebars, forms,
  navbar, graphs, avatars, projects/groups, editors, calendars, etc
- Project languages bar now looks better than before ([[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/-/issues/149][#149]])

** 1.0.0 [2020-04-14 Tue]
The rewrite is complete.

This update removes styles for all sub-domains except =next.gitlab.com=, and some
of the custom options. There are too many things to cover, so I'm not going to
do that, but you can go through all 489 commits in [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/-/merge_requests/30][!30]] if you're interested.

Going forward, I'll explore adding some sub-domains/pages back. I rarely use
them to justify putting a lot of effort into making them dark, and DarkReader
will do a decent job anyways.

Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for using this
userstyle and helping out with the project. Things wouldn't have been the same
without your help.
