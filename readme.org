** Installation
There are a few ways to install this userstyle.

*** With Stylus
The recommended method; allows for full customization of custom features.

1. Install [[https://add0n.com/stylus.html][Stylus]]
2. Click on the install link or install badge.
    #+begin_quote
    Installs from =gitlab.user.styl= file using [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/raw/master/gitlab.user.styl][this link]].
    #+end_quote
    [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/raw/master/gitlab.user.styl][https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat]]
3. Confirm the installation
4. Continue to /Initial configuration/

*** With /xStyle/, /Cascadia/, etc
This is for userstyle managers that don't support stylus-lang. It doesn't
offer the customizability that the recommended method offers.

1. Install your userstyle manager of choice
2. Click on the install link
   #+begin_quote
   Installs from =gitlab.user.css= file using [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/raw/master/gitlab.user.css][this link]].
   #+end_quote
3. Confirm the installation
4. Continue to /Initial configuration/

*** With /Stylish/ through /[[https://userstyles.org/styles/164877][userstyles.org]]/ (USo)
I don't recommended using this method because of the following reasons:

1. Stylish is spyware and USo is abandoned by the same developers
2. Only supported due to it being the largest repository of userstyles
3. Updated manually, is very likely outdated, and only has core functionality.

** Initial configuration
This step is mandatory if you want to tune settings to your liking, or
if you've changed GitLab's default preferences.

Dark-GitLab works best with /default/ settings as it tries to offer seamless
experience across all GitLab instances that you might stumble upon on the web.

The following [[https://gitlab.com/profile/preferences][preferences]] need to be set on instances you're logged in:
1. Set syntax highlighting theme set to =white=
2. Set navigation theme to =indigo=

To customize colors and/or other features, follow these instructions:
- Click on Stylus icon on your toolbar then on the configure button (gear icon)
  and you'll be able to configure everything from within the popup. Same menu
  can be opened from the /Manage/ page in Stylus.
- Additionally, install [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-switcher/][dark-switcher]] if you'd like to quickly switch between
  various pre-defined color-schemes.

** FAQ
This section covers frequently asked questions.

*** Why are there so many warnings and/or errors?
The linter that Stylus is using doesn't understand [[https://stylus-lang.com][Stylus-lang]] syntax. Disable
the linter and all warnings will be gone. More info can be found here:
[[https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/880][GitHub/openstyles/stylus/880]]

*** How to add custom domains?
Click on Stylus icon on your toolbar then on the edit button (pen icon) to open
it in the editor. When you get there, simply press on the =+= button to add a new
domain.

- ⚠ Modifying the code will prevent auto-update from working.
- See [[https://gitlab.com/vednoc/dark-gitlab/issues/99#note_265480670][#99]] for more info.

*** How to exclude a domain?
Click on Stylus icon on your toolbar then on the action menu button (three dots
icon) and choose domain/URL exclusion you want to use.

*** How to customize colors and/or other options?
Click on Stylus icon on your toolbar then on the configure button (gear icon)
and you'll be able to configure everything from within the popup. Same menu can
also be accessed from the /Manage/ page in Stylus.
